DATA 621: Business Analytics and Data Mining
Instructor Name: Nasrin Khansari
Instructor Email Address: nasrin.khansari@sps.cuny.edu
Degree Program: M.S. in Data Science
Credits: 3 graduate credits
Prerequisites: DATA 607; DATA 606
Type of Course: Required course
Course Description
This course develops the foundations of predictive modeling by introducing the key concepts of applied
regression modeling and its extensions. The main topics covered in this course include: simple and
multiple linear regression, variable selection and shrinkage methods, binary logistic regression, count
regression, weighted least squares, robust regression, generalized least squares, multinomial logistic
regression, generalized linear models, panel regression, and nonparametric regression. The course is
heavily weighted towards practical application using the R statistical programming language and data sets
containing missing values and outliers. The course also addresses issues of exploratory data analysis, data
preparation, model development, model validation, and model deployment.
Program Learning Outcomes:
• Business Understanding. Students will learn how applied regression modeling techniques can add
value to existing business analytics.
• Data Programming. Use industry standard statistical programming tools.
• Foundational Math and Statistics. Emphasis on probability, statistics, and computational methods.
• Data Culture. Students will learn how applied regression modeling can enhance business
capabilities and extend the value of existing data.
• Data Understanding. Students will learn how to explore data to find new patterns.
• Predictive Modeling. Selecting predictive modeling techniques, building and assessing models.
• Model Implementation. Students will learn to implement models for the various applied
regression modeling techniques covered in the course.
Learning Objectives:
• Demonstrate a practical understanding of the theoretical concepts behind applied regression
modeling.
• Analyze and select appropriate types and combinations of models given particular business
situations.
• Develop applied regression modeling techniques to address different types of data.
• Use R statistical software to build and deploy specific models based on real-world business
problems.

How is this course relevant for IS and data analytics professionals?
Regression modeling skills are crucial, high-value skills in today’s data-driven business environment where
real-world decision-making processes are complex. The ability to leverage rapidly expanding data sets to
obtain new insights is at the heart of predictive data analytics.
How does this course work?
The course is conducted entirely online via Blackboard. Each week, the student will complete assigned
readings from the required textbooks, watch lecture videos, complete optional (but recommended)
textbook exercises, complete homework assignments (not weekly), and participate in the discussion
board. There is also a final course project. Students are expected to complete all deliverables by their
assigned due dates.
Assignments and Grading
Course assignments Percentage of
Final Grade
Points
Homework Assignments 50% 500
 There will be 5 homework assignments (10% each, or 100
points each) used to re-enforce course concepts and provide
implementation experience in R.
Final Project 30% 300
 Students will form a group of 3 -4 people.
 Each group will submit a project.
 The project will require students to model a problem using any
of the methods learned in this course
Class Discussion 20% 200
 Each week, we will have a topic to discuss.
 A student is required to participate by introducing a question.
 A total of 5 blog entries will be required throughout the
semester based on a topic of your choice where a student
shares his or her thoughts on a statistical method and how
that can be used in a real life scenario based on your daily life
experience.
 These need to be completed by the end of the semester
Total 100% 1,000
Discussion Board Etiquette:
The purpose of the discussion board in general is to allow students to freely exchange ideas. It is
imperative to remain respectful of all viewpoints and positions and, when necessary, agree to respectfully
disagree. While active and frequent participation is encouraged, cluttering a discussion board with
inappropriate, irrelevant, or insignificant material will not earn additional points and may result in 
3
receiving less than full credit. Frequency is not unimportant, but content of the message is paramount.
Please remember to cite all sources (when relevant) in order to avoid plagiarism.
Late Policy:
Unless otherwise noted, all work is due on the assigned day by 11:59 PM (Eastern Time). This includes
homework assignments, projects, and participation in the discussions. In case of an extenuating
circumstance, we can make exception. Please be sure to contact me ahead of time.

Note on Timing Communications:
Office hours are conducted via GoToMeeting or phone. You are encouraged to ask questions on the course
discussion board where other students will be able to benefit from your inquiries. For the most part, you
can expect me to respond to questions by email within 24 to 48 hours. If you do not hear back from me
within 48 hours of sending an email, please resend your email. You can expect me to grade and return
assignments within 14 days. Please do not hesitate to ask if you have questions or concerns.
